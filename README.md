Old school space battle (work in progress)


[DEMO](https://jphamilton.github.io/havoc/build)

## About
Just wanted to play around with Pixi.js, Three.js, shaders, parallax scrolling and 2D camera's.
The feeling I'm going for is an old, forgotten demo cabinet gathering dust in basement of a long
dead arcade game company.

## Controls
Any key to start
Arrow keys to move
CTRL to fire
